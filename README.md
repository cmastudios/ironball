IronBall Game Manager
=====================
The goal of the IronBall plugin is to manage IronBall games. These are soccer-style games where an Iron Golem acts as the ball. Two teams compete to score goals on the other team by knocking the golem into the goal.

The plugin is inspired by IronBall-like arenas made on the Warhub server.

Playing IronBall
----------------
There are two teams - red and blue. When players join a game, they are randomly sorted and balanced into the two teams. The plugin will automatically rebalance teams when necessary.

Each player is given a Knockback stick and armor to represent their team. When the game starts, players try to score goals on the other team by hitting the golem with the stick.

Extra points are awarded to a team when a member of the other team causes a golem to go out-of-bounds or they kill the golem.
